# What Don't You Want?!
When it comes to selecting a restaurant for my girlfriend and I go to, this is the most asked question in our household! I thought I would make a web app to solve this problem then maybe make a React Native app later on.

## Focuses for the Project
- Performance
- TDD - Integration and only true Unit Tests for components that have logic
- E2E Testing

## Architecture Decisions : 

State Management - Context API
Lazy Loading + Suspense
React Router
React Hooks 
Styled Components
Axios
Cypress - E2E Testing
React Testing Library - Integration and Unit Tests

## Requirements : 
1) User can enter address or allow location sharing and add radius for search
2) User is presented with list of cuisine and can click what they don't want
3) User can click to proceed to next page and get a list of nearest restaurants to them
4) Button exists at the end to start over
